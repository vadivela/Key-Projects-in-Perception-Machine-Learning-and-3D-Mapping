Key Projects in Perception, Machine Learning, and 3D Mapping (2024)

3D Point Cloud Processing:
Developed custom algorithms for RANSAC Plane Fitting to robustly estimate planar surfaces in noisy 3D point clouds, and implemented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) from scratch to align separate point clouds. These methods enabled accurate plane fitting and precise point cloud registration for real-world and simulated datasets.

Deep Learning for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification:
Built and trained an autoencoder on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to extract compact latent representations of image data. Using these compressed features, I trained a supervised classifier that achieved 85% accuracy on unseen test samples, demonstrating effective feature extraction and classification performance.

Augmented Reality Visualization:
Created an AR visualization system using OpenCV and Aruco markers, estimating 3D poses of markers in camera frames and projecting 3D cubes onto the detected tags with precise geometric alignment. The project demonstrated real-time augmented reality overlays with accurate camera calibration.

Dynamic Object Tracking:
Implemented real-time object tracking in video sequences by combining YOLOv8 object detection with a custom tracking algorithm based on IoU and motion estimation. Successfully tracked multiple dynamic objects across frames with consistent IDs, even during partial occlusions and rapid movement.
